# OSG Virtual School 2021

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Transform your research with vast amounts of computing!</p>

The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC)&nbsp;&mdash;
whether on a local system or using
[OSG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2PzIy-vvaE&list=PLBWb4iScSWcPy7LQ4BuXmm8Z2xO4ZW1J_)&nbsp;&mdash;
to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science.
Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and
a personalized learning plan that includes one-on-one and small-group consulting with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own computational research.
The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area for whom large-scale computing 
is a vital part of the research process; we also consider applications from advanced undergraduates, 
post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff!

This virtual offering has been tuned for remote participation,
with the goal of helping attendees get their own work running within the 2-week period,
and is not merely a translation of the in-person program
(last offered in [2019](https://osg-htc.org/user-school-2019/)).

**The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2&ndash;6 and 9&ndash;13.** 
The event is free and materials will be posted publicly.
A selective application process is required for full participation,
which includes access to HTC experts and to HTC systems via the
[Center for High Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/approach.shtml) and
[OSG Connect](https://www.osgconnect.net/) service
(the latter otherwise available to researchers working on a U.S.-based academic, government, or non-profit research project).
Also, the public is invited to register and attend the five lectures during the first week;
for more information, see [the Public Lectures page](public-lectures.md).

While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility,
invited participants will be asked to commit at least 20 hours each week.
The [full schedule for 2021](schedule.md) is available to view.

Note: We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022!
